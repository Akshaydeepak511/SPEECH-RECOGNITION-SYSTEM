# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

A Speech Recognition System is an advanced technology that converts spoken language into text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This system leverages pre-trained models and libraries like SpeechRecognition and Wav2Vec2 to process and transcribe speech from audio files or real-time microphone input.

Key Features:

Automatic Speech Recognition 

Pre-trained Model Integration

Multi-Source Input

Noise Handling
